# 3D HandTracking Project

The 3D HandTracking project is an innovative endeavor that involves the fusion of Python and Unity to achieve real-time hand detection and interaction. This project showcases the potential of hand tracking by using Python to detect hand positions (left or right) and transmitting these coordinates as UDP scripts to Unity. This dynamic interaction allows for the creation of images where the user's hand can interact with virtual objects.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection using Python.
- Transmission of hand coordinates to Unity using UDP scripts.
- Rendering a virtual image of the user's hand interacting with virtual objects.
- Seamless integration of Python and Unity for an engaging user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Hean-Chhinling3d-handtracking.git`
2. Set up the Python environment: Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up Unity: Open the Unity project in the `unity` directory.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script for hand detection: `python hand_tracking.py`.
2. Open the Unity project and play the scene to visualize the interaction between the virtual hand and objects.
3. Observe how the real-time hand detection coordinates influence the virtual hand's behavior.

## Technologies Used

- Python: A versatile programming language used for real-time hand tracking.
- Unity: A powerful game development engine utilized for creating the virtual environment.
- UDP: A protocol used for transmitting data between the Python script and Unity.
